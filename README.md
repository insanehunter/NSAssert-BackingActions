NSAssert+BackingActions
=======================

Assertion macros to make your program more robust even in Release builds.

If you are a battle hardened game development veteran or just a fan of assertions, you know that these checks are not included in Release builds when `NS_BLOCK_ASSERTIONS` macro is defined.

But what would happen to your application if it encounters a rare untested case where assertion fails in Release? It will continue execution and do some senseless job, or even crash!

So here's where `NSAssert+BackingActions` shines! You can supply a backing action, that works only in Release to redirect program flow and avoid executing code with failed precondition.

## Usage
Add `NSAssert+BackingActions.h` to your precompiled header. And now you can use the following macros:

* `NSAssertOrReturn`, `NSParameterAssertOrReturn` - does `return` in Release if assertion condition fails.
* `NSAssertOrReturnNil`, `NSParameterOrReturnNil` - all the same, but returns nil.
* `NSAssertOrReturnNO`, `NSParameterAssertOrReturnNO`
* `NSAssertOrBreak`, `NSParameterAssertOrBreak`
* `NSAssertOrContinue`, `NSParameterAssertOrContinue`

By default when action backed assertion fails in Release, it prints warning using `NSLog`. You can suppress logging by defining `NS_ASSERT_SUPRESS_BACKING_ACTION_LOGGING` macro or provide your own logging facility by defining `NSReleaseAssertionLog(args, â€¦)` macro.

## Example
    - (NSArray *) documentsFromDate:(NSDate *)startDate toDate:(NSDate *)endDate
    {
        NSParameterAssertOrReturnNil(startDate != nil);
        NSParameterAssertOrReturnNil(endDate != nil);
        
        ...
    }
    
If somewhere in your code you call `documentsFromDate:toDate` with `nil`, it will raise exception in Debug or return `nil` in Release. 

## Requirements
I presume `NSAssert+BackingActions` should work in Xcode 4.0+ both on OSX and iOS, in both ARC and non-ARC environments.
